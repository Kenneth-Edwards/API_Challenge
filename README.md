API Assignment pulling weather data for analysis

My Observations:
1. Temperatures between the -20 and 40th latitudes are consistently higher than north or south of these latitudes as is expected and given the tilt of the earth the temperatures north of the 40th parrellel are noticebly cooler than south of the 40th parrellel south. Thus there is a correlation between lattitude and temperature.

2. There appears to be little correlation between humidity and latitude except possibly between the 15th parrellel north and 15th parrellel south where the humidity is much higher than further north or south thus there only appears to be some correlation between latitude and humidity between the 15th parrellel north and 15th parrellel south.

3. I find no significant patterns or correlation between latitude and cloudiness or wind speed.
